            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce I had the honour of ſpeaking laſt to your Excellence, I reflected (by occaſion pf ſeveral Diſcourſes had this week with Perſons of quality) on the dayly encreaſe of the Fears and jealouies of my Country-men: Which is the Reaſon, That inſtead of waiting on you this morning about private Concernments, (as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) I choſe rather out of my unalterable affection to your ſelf, to give firſt this Paper, and therein my thoughts and my deſires relating to the Publick, that is, to your ſelf and to His Majeſty, and his Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord, I thought fit to tell you, That conſidering the general fear ſeiz'd already almoſt on all the Nobility, Gentry, and others here of that Nation, and reflecting on the vaſt difference betwixt my own belief and theirs, it ſeems to me, I behold (in us particularly, who have for ſo many years ſo much relied on your word and vertue) ſomewhat fulfilled, not unlike the myſterious extinction of all the Lights to one in the Ceremony of <hi>Tenebra</hi> in holy week. For, my Lord, I obſerve in the generality of the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> here, even (I ſay) of thoſe who have been ſo long as well your conſtant believers as your paſſionate ſticklers, a dimneſſe and darkneſſe ſeizing their judgments; even your faſteſt friends heretofore, loſing at preſent their faith of your future appearance for tnem, and hopes of their delivery by you at any time evermore: Some through ignorance of State affairs, and intrigues obſtructing as yet: others through inconſideration of thoſe wayes you take much wiſer, though ſlower, than folly and raſhneſſe could chalk out: and ſome out of prejudice or an evil paſſion, which blinds them and makes them abuſe the timorouſneſſe and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>lity of all they can; to leſſen your eſteem and your dependencies, all they are able.</p>
            <p>My Lord, theſe are thoughts, which more and more trouble me dayly: becauſe I have dayly new occaſions to reflect on them. And therefore would no longer but give <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>n your Excellence, even in this method and in writing, that they might take the deeper impreſſion; as very much concerning you, ſince your own welfare, and the Kings and Peoples (in my judgment) very much depends on a good eſteem of ſo great a Miniſter, as your great deſerts have made you.</p>
            <p>But with all, My Lord, I will give your Excellence my moſt earneſt, and moſt humble deſires that you delay no longer than ſhall be neceſſary, to clear theſe clouds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and clear them in this preſent conjunctuve, by an effectuall demonſtration of that juſtice and favour you intended the Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> in your Articles of 48. then they ſo freely put themſelves and their power into your hands. I am not ignorant that ſome have after tranſgreſſed in a high nature. But you know, my Lord, there are many thouſands of Proteſtants in the three Kingdomes, who have been far more hainouſly criminal, both againſt his Majeſty and againſt his Father <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

Yet if theſe unfortunate Catholick tranſgreſſors muſt be alone, in this generall <hi>Jubile</hi> of the three Nations, held unworthy to rejoyce in the Kings reſtauration; if they alone, beſides their moſt grievous and moſt unparallel'd ſufferings under tyranny theſe eight or nine years paſt, muſt a-new ſuffer, and yet a <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1+ letters">

And what I beg, my Lord, is That his Majeſty not ſo much regard the power of our Adverſaryes as the juſtice of our cauſe. My Lord, their power is no greater at this time, than his Majeſty is pleaſed to continue or make it. There a huge difference betwixt their influence on the meaner Officers and common Souldiers now, and that it was in the time of the Long Parliament, or in the dayes of tyranny and anarchy. In a word it will ſignifie a meer nothing, if once uncommiſſioned by his Majeſty, and the common Souldiers payed.</p>

Not although theſe <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> when they articled by their Predeceſſors, were Inſidels, enemies or one true God, and their articles made with true believers, and believers infallibly ſuch, and not with <hi>Saul,</hi> but with <hi>Joſue,</hi> 300 years before the Raign of <hi>Saul,</hi> and never by him ratified. Nor although, what is more obſervable, theſe articles were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of <hi>Joſhua</hi> through his ignorance of the people that treated with him, and by their lyes and circumvention of him. Nor finally, although theſe Articles were aſſented unto by <hi>Joſhua</hi> only, and his twelve chief Captains; the whole multitude (concern'd in this buſineſs) not conſenting otherwiſe; as appeared within three dayes after the Concluſion, by their generall murmur againſt the Prince. My Lord, none of all theſe extenuating circumſtances, nor altogether, not even back't with zeal for the people of God (the Scripture nothing particularly that <hi>Saul ſought to ſlay the Gibeonites in his zeal to the Children of Iſrael and Judah</hi>) no excuſe, no pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever could obtayn ſo much mercy of the great Juſticier of Heaven, as to inflict the puniſhment of this article-breaking on the perſon of <hi>Saul</hi> alone; not even together with his beloved <hi>Jonathan's,</hi> or on his Legions, and People in his own dayes only. The vengeance of God muſt purſue his Poſterity and Kingdome, long after his death, and for this cauſe alone. A mortal Famine of three years continuance muſt conſume the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even in the reign of his Succeſſor; and for this very Sin only, as God himſelf revealed to holy <hi>David.</hi> Nor would the Famine ceaſe, till by <hi>David</hi>'s commandment ſeven of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Children and Nephews were delivered to the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>; and by the hands of theſe very men whoſe Articles he broke, crucified alive upon a Mountain, to expiate this publick and horrid ſin, even in the face of the Sun. May Providence, and the Kings Righteoſneſs, and your ſage Counſel (my Lord) obſtruct all occaſions of reflecting on this (and ſo many other examples of God's revenge of Article-breaking) any further than that the beſt of Kings may ſee the worſt of evils attending the Counſels of our Adverſaries: and that their power, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, cannot be ſo dangerous as their demands againſt our Articles.</p>
